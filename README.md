A stopwatch is a handheld device that measures the time that has passed between the start and end points. Stopwatches can be used to measure in seconds, hundredths of a second, or thousandths of a second. They can be used in many applications, including:
Garment industry: Stopwatches can measure the time an operator spends on each activity.
Science: Stopwatches can be used to measure time precisely and with minimal complications, such as in laboratory experiments.
Sporting events: Stopwatches can record time as precisely as possible, as even a millionth of a second can make a difference between first and second place.
